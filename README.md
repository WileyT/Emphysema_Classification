# Emphysema_Classification

This repository was created for the course project in the CPS8207 - Digital Image Processing course available at Toronto Metropolitan University. This outlines the 
models used.

## Objective / Solution
According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics published in 2019, COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing a total of 3.23 million deaths.
The main focus for this project is a COPD related disease known as Emphysema. Emphysema is when the lung tissue and air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs are damaged which 
causes shortness of breath. Although the mortality rate is high, it can be significantly improve if COPD related diseases are diagnosed and treated early. 
However, with the lack of radiologists interpreting chest x-ray (CXR) images, it becomes a challenge to diagnose lung diseases quickly and accurately. 
Thus, machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques can act as a computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) tool to assist and expedite the procedure.
